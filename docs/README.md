# BananaGUI documentation

The documentation is not meant to be viewed on GitHub. [The 
tutorial](tutorial.rst) works just fine, but that's about it.

**TODO:** add docs to akuli.github.io and link here.

If you want to build the docs and read them without an Internet 
connection, you can also do that:

```
$ yourpython -m pip install --user sphinx
$ cd /some/path/to/BananaGUI/docs
$ yourpython -m sphinx . _build
$ yourpython -m webbrowser _build/index.html
```
