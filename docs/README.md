# BananaGUI Documentation

## Tutorial

If you are just getting started with BananaGUI you probably want to 
start here. You don't need to be familiar with writing GUI's and you 
don't even need to know what is a GUI. All you need is basic Python 
skills.

1. [Hello World step by step](tutorial/hello-world.md)
2. [Parent widgets](tutorial/parents.md)

## API Reference

There's a lot of more detailed documentation about BananaGUI in the 
docstrings. An easy way to read it is doing `help(something)` on the 
`>>>` prompt.

If you want to read the documentation in a web browser, it's also 
possible. On Windows, run this on a command prompt:

    py -m pydoc -b

On other operating systems, run this on a terminal instead:

    python3 -m pydoc -b

Python's documentation will open in a web browser window. Find bananagui 
and click it.
