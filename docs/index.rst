Beginner-friendly Tutorial
--------------------------

If you don't know what BananaGUI is or you haven't used it before I 
recommend starting here. The tutorial does not explain how to use every 
feature of BananaGUI, but you'll get started with BananaGUI. You'll be 
able to read the API Reference after reading this tutorial. You don't 
need to be familiar with GUI programming, all you need is basic Python 
skills.
